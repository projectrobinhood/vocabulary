==========

JAM team's vocabulary

 . Everyone has one vocabulary file.
 . When you want to update the file, just overwrite it in your local disc and
   commit the changes to GitHub server. GitHub will know what you have modified.
   So you only need one file and GitHub will record all the history changes.
   Do not upload a new file every week.
